# Wizard’s Intent — An Intent-Centric Interactive Frontend Prototype

## Overview  
**Wizard’s Intent** is an H5-based interactive prototype that uses a retro **8-bit game-inspired interface** to demonstrate **Anoma’s intent-centric architecture**.  
Through the story of a young wizard saving the Anoma continent, the project makes complex ideas tangible by comparing **traditional multi-step transactions** with **one-click intent-driven operations**.

## Core Highlights  

### 1️⃣ Project Overview  
Wizard’s Intent is an **interactive frontend prototype** that blends **retro game aesthetics** with **intent-centric logic**, turning technical concepts into a fun and educational experience.  

### 2️⃣ Intent-Centric Transactions  
Players first experience **traditional, multi-step processes** (e.g., gem → token A → token B → gold → weapon purchase) and then compare it with **a single intent click** that achieves the same result.  
This contrast makes the **efficiency and simplicity of intent-driven architecture** clear.  

### 3️⃣ Combat & Spellcasting  
The game demonstrates **traditional combat flow** (multiple steps of chanting and spell execution) versus **intent-driven one-click casting**, highlighting **automation and user-friendly execution**.  

### 4️⃣ Solver Visualization  
Each intent action reveals a **simplified solver output (pseudo-code)**, allowing players to see how the network **matches, optimizes, and resolves operations** behind the scenes.  

### 5️⃣ Multi-Chain Coordination  
Through story and interaction design, the prototype illustrates how **Anoma abstracts cross-chain complexity**, letting the network—not the user—handle multi-chain execution.  

### 6️⃣ User-Centric Design  
The prototype adopts a **3DS-style dual-screen layout**:  
- **Top screen:** retro 8-bit scene  
- **Bottom screen:** dialogue & operations  

This approach makes the prototype **approachable for newcomers** while retaining **technical relevance for experts**.  

### 7️⃣ Value Summary  
Wizard’s Intent is more than a game—it is a **lightweight, interactive, and visual demo tool**.  
It makes **Anoma’s intent-centric paradigm** visible, understandable, and engaging, making it ideal for **community events, educational showcases, and competition submissions**.
